Travel Buddy is simple to use. Give your entry a name and a dollar amount, then click add or subtract for deposits or expenses respectively. Your entries will be recorded and the change over time is shown in the chart. If at any point your connection is dropped you will still be able to make entries, and when you're back online they'll be uploaded to the database.
